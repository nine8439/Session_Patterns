#Server Session Patterns

    +Maintain a session during while a client is interacting with a server and database
    +Object-Oriented Frameworks are structured in terms of client/server relationship between objects; an object's services are invoked by client objects through the operations of its interface
    + A common design requirement is for a server object to maintain state for each client that it is serving.
    + This is usually implemented by returning handles or untyped pointers to the client that are used to identify the per-client data structure holding its state
    + The lack of strong typing can lead to obscure errors that complicate debugging and maintenance
